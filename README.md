module 1 - LangGraph
---
Video 1: motivation

 Ideas Acquired

 comprehended how LangGraph applications operate.

 Both manual and LLM-driven control flows are possible.

 The results are less dependable the more autonomy the LLM is given; LangGraph fills this reliability gap.

 Remarks

 In this video, no code is executed.


-Video 2: Simple Graph-
-----------

Ideas Acquired

 learned about the nodes and edges that make up a LangGraph.

 examined graph states and conditional edges.

 The StateGraph() builder was used to create a graph.

 Modifications Made

 Conditional nodes were changed to examine the user's mood from the input text.

 Now, input semantics (e.g., text in all caps â†’ angry tone) determine node selection.

 A total of five conditional nodes were added.

 The initial graph state was prefixed with a custom string.

Commit Summary

-------------------
Video 3: Studio
-----------

Concepts Learned

Set up and ran a local LangSmith Studio development server.

Visualized graph execution directly in the browser interface.

Changes Implemented

Updated simple.py to match the customized graph from Video 2.

Executed and visualized the run in Studio.

Saved the studio visualization as a PNG in the Module 1 folder.

Video 4: Chain
------------------

Concepts Learned

Revisited tool calling concepts.

Integrated tools into graphs through chains where messages represent nodes.

Changes Implemented

Created a custom tool-calling function for retrieving quotes by category.

Modified the initial message list for testing.

Commit Summary


Video 5: Router
----------------------------------
Concepts Learned

Understood the Router node concept.

In a Chain, the LLM calls a tool and ends; in a Router, the LLM decides whether to call a tool or proceed directly to the end node.

Changes Implemented

Integrated the quote retrieval tool from the Chain module.

Modified router.py with the new tool-calling logic.

Ran and visualized the updated router in LangSmith Studio.

Video 6: Agent
---------------------------------------------
Concepts Learned

Built an Agent using the ReAct principle, where outputs loop back as inputs until completion.

Practiced iterative reasoning within tool-calling nodes.

Changes Implemented

Replaced arithmetic functions with string manipulation tools (reverse text, prefix text, etc.).

Adjusted user prompts accordingly.

Tested and traced the agent successfully in LangSmith Studio.
